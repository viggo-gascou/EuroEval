# The `euroeval` Python Package

The `euroeval` Python package is the Python package used to evaluate language models in
EuroEval. This page will give you a brief overview of the package and how to use it.
You can also check out the [full API reference](/api/euroeval/) for more details.

## Installation

To install the package simply write the following command in your favorite terminal:

```bash
pip install euroeval[all]
```

This will install the EuroEval package with all extras. You can also install the
minimal version by leaving out the `[all]`, in which case the package will let you know
when an evaluation requires a certain extra dependency, and how you install it.

## Quickstart

### Benchmarking

`euroeval` allows for benchmarking both via. script and using the command line.

/// tab | Using the command line

The easiest way to benchmark pretrained models is via the command line interface. After
having installed the package, you can benchmark your favorite model like so:

```bash
euroeval --model <model-id>
```

Here `model` is the HuggingFace model ID, which can be found on the [HuggingFace
Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). By default this will benchmark the model on all
the tasks available. If you want to benchmark on a particular task, then use the
`--task` argument:

```bash
euroeval --model <model-id> --task sentiment-classification
```

We can also narrow down which languages we would like to benchmark on. This can be done
by setting the `--language` argument. Here we thus benchmark the model on the Danish
sentiment classification task:

```bash
euroeval --model <model-id> --task sentiment-classification --language da
```

Multiple models, datasets and/or languages can be specified by just attaching multiple
arguments. Here is an example with two models:

```bash
euroeval --model <model-id1> --model <model-id2>
```

The specific model version/revision to use can also be added after the suffix '@':

```bash
euroeval --model <model-id>@<commit>
```

This can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. It defaults to 'main' for latest.

See all the arguments and options available for the `euroeval` command by typing

```bash
euroeval --help
```

///

/// tab | Using a script

In a script, the syntax is similar to the command line interface. You simply initialise
an object of the `Benchmarker` class, and call this benchmark object with your favorite
model:

```python
>>> from euroeval import Benchmarker
>>> benchmarker = Benchmarker()
>>> benchmarker.benchmark(model="<model-id>")
```

To benchmark on a specific task and/or language, you simply specify the `task` or
`language` arguments, shown here with same example as above:

```python
>>> benchmarker.benchmark(
...     model="<model-id>",
...     task="sentiment-classification",
...     language="da",
... )
```

If you want to benchmark a subset of all the models on the Hugging Face Hub, you can
simply leave out the `model` argument. In this example, we're benchmarking all Danish
models on the Danish sentiment classification task:

```python
>>> benchmarker.benchmark(task="sentiment-classification", language="da")
```

///

/// tab | Using Docker

A Dockerfile is provided in the repo, which can be downloaded and run, without needing
to clone the repo and installing from source. This can be fetched programmatically by
running the following:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EuroEval/EuroEval/main/Dockerfile
```

Next, to be able to build the Docker image, first ensure that the NVIDIA Container
Toolkit is
[installed](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#installation)
and
[configured](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#configuring-docker).
Ensure that the the CUDA version stated at the top of the Dockerfile matches the CUDA
version installed (which you can check using `nvidia-smi`). After that, we build the
image as follows:

```bash
docker build --pull -t euroeval .
```

With the Docker image built, we can now evaluate any model as follows:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus 1 euroeval <euroeval-arguments>
```

Here `<euroeval-arguments>` consists of the arguments added to the `euroeval` CLI
argument. This could for instance be `--model <model-id> --task
sentiment-classification`.
///

## Benchmarking custom inference APIs

If the model you want to benchmark is hosted by a custom inference provider, such as a
[vLLM server](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/), then this is also supported in EuroEval.

When benchmarking, you simply have to set the `--api-base` argument (`api_base` when
using the `Benchmarker` API) to the URL of the inference API, and optionally the
`--api-key` argument (`api_key`) to the API key, if authentication is required.

If you're benchmarking an Ollama model, then you're urged to add the prefix
`ollama_chat/` to the model name, as that will also fetch model metadata as well as pull
the models from the Ollama model repository before evaluating it, e.g.:

```bash
euroeval --model ollama_chat/mymodel --api-base http://localhost:11434
```

For all other OpenAI-compatible inference APIs, you simply provide the model name as
is, e.g.:

```bash
euroeval --model my-model --api-base http://localhost:8000
```

Again, if the inference API requires authentication, you simply add the `--api-key`
argument:

```bash
euroeval --model my-model --api-base http://localhost:8000 --api-key my-secret-key
```

If your model is a reasoning model, then you need to specify this as follows:

```bash
euroeval --model my-reasoning-model --api-base http://localhost:8000 --generative-type reasoning
```

Likewise, if it is a pretrained decoder model (aka a completion model), then you specify
this as follows:

```bash
euroeval --model my-base-decoder-model --api-base http://localhost:8000 --generative-type base
```

When using the `Benchmarker` API, the same applies. Here is an example of benchmarking
an Ollama model hosted locally:

```python
>>> benchmarker.benchmark(
...     model="ollama_chat/mymodel",
...     api_base="http://localhost:11434",
... )
```

## Benchmarking in an offline environment

If you need to benchmark in an offline environment, you need to download the models,
datasets and metrics beforehand. For example to download the model you want and all of
the Danish sentiment classification datasets:

/// tab | Using the command line
This can be done by adding the `--download-only` argument, from the command line:

```bash
euroeval --model <model-id> --task sentiment-classification --language da --download-only
```

///
/// tab | Using a script
This can be done using the `download_only` argument, if benchmarking from a script:

```python
benchmarker.benchmark(
  model="<model-id>",
  task="sentiment-classification",
  language="da",
  download_only=True,
)
```

///

!!! note
    Offline benchmarking of adapter models is not currently supported, meaning that we
    still require an internet connection during the evaluation of these. If offline
    support of adapters is important to you, please consider [opening an
    issue](https://github.com/EuroEval/EuroEval/issues).

## Overriding model metadata

Some models do not have metadata (maximum context length and vocabulary size) specified,
or have it specified incorrectly. This leads to incorrect values on the leaderboards.
To work around this you can manually override these values using the
`--max-context-length` and `--vocabulary-size` arguments:

/// tab | Using the command line

```bash
euroeval --model <model-id> --max-context-length 4096 --vocabulary-size 32000
```

///

/// tab | Using a script

```python
>>> benchmarker.benchmark(
...     model="<model-id>",
...     max_context_length=4096,
...     vocabulary_size=32000,
... )
```

///

## Benchmarking custom datasets

If you want to benchmark models on your own custom dataset, this is also possible.
First, you need to set up your dataset to be compatible with EuroEval. This means
splitting up your dataset in a training, validation and test split. By default, EuroEval
expects these standard column names:

- **Text or multiple-choice classification**: `text` and `label`
- **Token classification**: `tokens` and `labels`
- **Reading comprehension**: `text` and `answers`
- **Free-form text generation**: `text` and `target_text`

If your dataset uses different column names, you can specify the mapping via
`input_column`, `target_column`, and `choices_column` in `DatasetConfig` (see
[Custom column names](#custom-column-names) below) — no need to rename your columns
beforehand.

Text and multiple-choice classification tasks are by far the most common. Then you can
decide whether your dataset should be accessible locally (good for testing, and good for
sensitive datasets), or accessible via the Hugging Face Hub (good for allowing others to
benchmark on your dataset).

/// tab | Local dataset

For a local dataset, you store your three dataset splits as three different CSV files
with the desired two columns, and then you create a file called `custom_datasets.py`
in which you define the associated `DatasetConfig` objects for your dataset. Here
is an example of a simple text classification dataset with two classes:

```python title="custom_datasets.py"
from euroeval import DatasetConfig, TEXT_CLASSIFICATION
from euroeval.languages import ENGLISH

MY_CONFIG = DatasetConfig(
    name="my-dataset",
    pretty_name="My Dataset",
    source=dict(train="train.csv", val="val.csv", test="test.csv"),
    task=TEXT_CLASSIFICATION,
    languages=[ENGLISH],
    labels=["positive", "negative"],
)
```

You can then benchmark your custom dataset by simply running

```bash
euroeval --dataset my-dataset --model <model-id>
```

You can also run the benchmark from a Python script, by simply providing your custom
dataset configuration directly into the `benchmark` method:

```python
from euroeval import Benchmarker

benchmarker = Benchmarker()
benchmarker.benchmark(model="<model-id>", dataset=MY_CONFIG)
```

///
/// tab | Hugging Face Hub dataset (YAML config)

The simplest and most secure way to add a EuroEval configuration to a Hugging Face Hub
dataset is via a YAML file. No Python code is written, so no `--trust-remote-code` flag
is required.

Create a file called `eval.yaml` in the root of your dataset repository. The file
follows the [Inspect AI `eval.yaml` format](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/tasks.html#hugging-face)
and works with both Inspect AI and EuroEval:

```yaml title="eval.yaml"
name: My Dataset
tasks:
  - id: my_dataset
    split: test
    field_spec:
      input: review
      target: sentiment
    solvers:
      - name: generate
    scorers:
      - name: choice
# EuroEval-specific keys (optional; ignored by Inspect AI)
task: classification
languages:
  - en
labels:
  - positive
  - negative
```

The EuroEval-specific keys (`task`, `languages`, `labels`, and all other
`DatasetConfig` arguments) are placed at the top level alongside the standard Inspect
AI `tasks` block.  Inspect AI silently ignores keys it does not recognise, so the same
file works for both frameworks.

The value of `task` must be one of the task names used in EuroEval
(e.g. `classification`, `sentiment-classification`,
`named-entity-recognition`, `multiple-choice`, etc.).  `languages` is a list of
[ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language codes.

All other `DatasetConfig` arguments are also supported:

```yaml title="eval.yaml"
name: My Dataset
tasks:
  - id: my_dataset
    split: test
    field_spec:
      input: review
      target: sentiment
    solvers:
      - name: generate
    scorers:
      - name: choice
# EuroEval-specific keys (optional; ignored by Inspect AI)
task: classification
languages:
  - en
labels:
  - positive
  - negative
num_few_shot_examples: 12
max_generated_tokens: 5
prompt_label_mapping:
  positive: positive
  negative: negative
```

The EuroEval-specific `task` and `languages` keys are **optional** — EuroEval will
infer them automatically when they are absent:

- **`task`** is inferred from the Inspect AI `tasks` block: a solver with
  `name: multiple_choice` **or** a `field_spec.choices` entry both map to the
  `multiple-choice` task.
- **`languages`** are read from the Hugging Face Hub repository metadata
  (the `language` field in the dataset card).  If the language cannot be determined,
  EuroEval defaults to English and logs a warning.

This means a standard Inspect AI `eval.yaml` with no EuroEval-specific keys works
out of the box:

```yaml title="eval.yaml"
# Pure Inspect AI format — no EuroEval keys required
name: My Dataset
description: My dataset description.
tasks:
  - id: my_dataset
    split: test
    field_spec:
      input: question
      target: answer
      choices: options
    solvers:
      - name: multiple_choice
    scorers:
      - name: choice
```

Column names can also be supplied as flat top-level keys (`input_column`,
`target_column`, `choices_column`) instead of inside the `field_spec` block;
top-level keys take precedence when both are present.  Note that Inspect AI allows
`field_spec.target` values such as `"literal:A"` (a hard-coded answer string) and
bare integers (mapped to letters A, B, C … by Inspect AI); EuroEval silently ignores
both forms because they are not column names.

The standard Inspect AI task keys are also used directly by EuroEval:

- **`tasks[0].split`** — the evaluation split to use (e.g. `test`, `validation`).
  EuroEval uses this as the test split, so no separate EuroEval key is needed.
- **`tasks[0].config`** — the Hugging Face dataset config/subset name (e.g. `main`,
  `default`).  EuroEval automatically appends it when loading the dataset.

You can then benchmark your custom dataset by simply running

```bash
euroeval --dataset <org-id>/<repo-id> --model <model-id>
```

or from a Python script:

```python
from euroeval import Benchmarker

benchmarker = Benchmarker()
benchmarker.benchmark(model="<model-id>", dataset="<org-id>/<repo-id>")
```

///
/// tab | Hugging Face Hub dataset (Python config)

For a dataset that is accessible via the Hugging Face Hub, you can also create a
file called `euroeval_config.py` in the root of your repository, in which you define
the associated dataset configuration. This gives you full Python flexibility (e.g.
custom preprocessing functions) but requires the `--trust-remote-code` flag.  Note
that you don't need to specify the `name`, `pretty_name` or `source` arguments in this
case, as these are automatically inferred from the repository name. Here is an example
of a simple text classification dataset with two classes:

```python title="euroeval_config.py"
from euroeval import DatasetConfig, TEXT_CLASSIFICATION
from euroeval.languages import ENGLISH

CONFIG = DatasetConfig(
    task=TEXT_CLASSIFICATION,
    languages=[ENGLISH],
    labels=["positive", "negative"],
)
```

!!! note

    To benchmark a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub using a Python config, you always
    need to set the `--trust-remote-code` flag (or `trust_remote_code=True` if using
    the `Benchmarker`), as the dataset configuration is loaded from the remote code.
    We advise you to always look at the code of the dataset configuration before running
    the benchmark.

You can then benchmark your custom dataset by simply running

```bash
euroeval --dataset <org-id>/<repo-id> --model <model-id> --trust-remote-code
```

You can also run the benchmark from a Python script, by simply providing your repo ID to
the `benchmark` method:

```python
from euroeval import Benchmarker

benchmarker = Benchmarker()
benchmarker.benchmark(
    model="<model-id>", dataset="<org-id>/<repo-id>", trust_remote_code=True
)
```

You can try it out with our [test
dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EuroEval/test_dataset):

```bash
euroeval --dataset EuroEval/test_dataset --model <model-id> --trust-remote-code
```

///

### Custom column names

If your dataset uses column names that differ from EuroEval's expected names, you can
specify a column mapping directly in `DatasetConfig` using the `input_column`,
`target_column`, and `choices_column` arguments. EuroEval will rename (or merge) the
columns at load time, so you don't need to preprocess your dataset beforehand.

**`input_column`** — the name of the column containing the input text. Defaults to
`"text"` (no rename). If set to a different value, that column is renamed to `"text"`.

```python
DatasetConfig(
    name="my-dataset",
    ...,
    input_column="review",   # rename "review" → "text"
)
```

**`target_column`** — the name of the column containing the label. If set, the column
is renamed to the task-appropriate standard name (`"label"` for classification,
`"labels"` for token classification, `"target_text"` for text-to-text).

```python
DatasetConfig(
    name="my-dataset",
    ...,
    target_column="sentiment",   # rename "sentiment" → "label" (for classification)
)
```

**`choices_column`** — for multiple-choice tasks, the column (or list of columns)
containing the answer choices. A single string names a column that holds a *list* of
choice strings. A list of strings names separate columns, each holding one choice
string. When set, the input text and choices are automatically merged into the
formatted `"text"` column that EuroEval expects.

```python
# Single column holding a list of choices
DatasetConfig(
    name="my-mcq-dataset",
    ...,
    choices_column="choices",
    target_column="answer",
)

# Separate columns, one per choice
DatasetConfig(
    name="my-mcq-dataset",
    ...,
    input_column="question",
    choices_column=["choice_a", "choice_b", "choice_c", "choice_d"],
    target_column="answer",
)
```

**`preprocessing_func`** — for full control, you can supply an arbitrary preprocessing
function that receives a `DatasetDict` and returns a `DatasetDict`. If this argument
is provided together with any of the column arguments above, `preprocessing_func` takes
precedence and the column arguments are ignored (a warning is logged in this case).

```python
def my_preprocess(dataset):
    for split_name, split in dataset.items():
        split = split.rename_column("review", "text")
        split = split.rename_column("stars", "label")
        dataset[split_name] = split
    return dataset

DatasetConfig(
    name="my-dataset",
    ...,
    preprocessing_func=my_preprocess,
)
```

We have included three convenience tasks to make it easier to set up custom datasets:

- `TEXT_CLASSIFICATION`, which is used for text classification tasks. This requires you
  to set the `labels` argument in the `DatasetConfig`, and requires the columns `text`
  and `label` to be present in the dataset.
- `MULTIPLE_CHOICE`, which is used for multiple-choice classification tasks. This
  also requires you to set the `labels` argument in the `DatasetConfig`. Note that for
  multiple choice tasks, you need to set up your `text` column to also list all the
  choices, and all the samples should have the same number of choices. This requires the
  columns `text` and `label` to be present in the dataset.
- `TOKEN_CLASSIFICATION`, which is used when classifying individual tokens in a text.
  This also require you to set the `labels` argument in the `DatasetConfig`. This
  requires the columns `tokens` and `labels` to be present in the dataset, where
  `tokens` is a list of tokens/words in the text, and `labels` is a list of the
  corresponding labels for each token (so the two lists have the same length).

On top of these three convenience tasks, there are of course also the tasks that we use
in the official benchmark, which you can use if you want to use one of these tasks with
your own bespoke dataset:

- `LA`, for linguistic acceptability datasets.
- `NER`, for named entity recognition datasets with the standard BIO tagging scheme.
- `RC`, for reading comprehension datasets in the SQuAD format.
- `SENT`, for sentiment classification datasets.
- `SUMM`, for text summarisation datasets.
- `KNOW`, for multiple-choice knowledge datasets (e.g., MMLU).
- `MCRC`, for multiple-choice reading comprehension datasets (e.g., Belebele).
- `COMMON_SENSE`, for multiple-choice common-sense reasoning datasets (e.g., HellaSwag).

These can all be imported from `euroeval.tasks` module.

### Creating your own custom task

You are of course also free to define your own task from scratch, which allows you to
customise the prompts used when evaluating generative models, for instance. When
creating a custom task you need to specify a `task_group`, which determines the overall
type of task and the required dataset columns. Below are examples for each supported
task group.

The `PromptConfig` object defines the prompts used for evaluation and accepts the
following arguments:

- `default_prompt_prefix`: Introductory text shown before the few-shot examples (only
  required for base decoders).
- `default_prompt_template`: Template used to format each example in few-shot
  evaluation (only required for base decoders). Available placeholders depend on the
  task group (see examples below).
- `default_instruction_prompt`: Template used for instruction-tuned models (zero-shot
  or instruction-style evaluation). Available placeholders depend on the task group (see
  examples below).
- `default_prompt_label_mapping`: A mapping from label strings to human-readable
  phrases used in the prompts (e.g., `{"b-per": "person"}`). Set to `"auto"` for a 1:1
  mapping or to an empty `dict()` for tasks that don't use labels in prompts.

/// tab | Sequence classification

**Task group**: `TaskGroup.SEQUENCE_CLASSIFICATION`

**Required dataset columns**: `text` (string), `label` (string)

The `label` column should contain the class label as a string. You must provide the
list of possible labels in the `DatasetConfig`.

**Available placeholders** in `PromptConfig`:

- `{text}`: The input text.
- `{label}`: The label for the example (empty string for the new sample).
- `{labels_str}`: A formatted string listing all possible labels.

)
```

///
/// tab | Multiple-choice classification

**Task group**: `TaskGroup.MULTIPLE_CHOICE_CLASSIFICATION`

**Required dataset columns**: `text` (string), `label` (string)

The `label` column should be the letter of the correct choice (e.g., `"a"`). The `text`
column must include both the question and the formatted answer choices. You can either
pre-format the `text` column yourself, or use `choices_column` in `DatasetConfig` to
have EuroEval merge a separate choices column (or per-choice columns) into `text`
automatically. The merged format is:

```text
<question>
Choices:
a. <choice 0>
b. <choice 1>
...
```

All samples must have the same number of choices. You must provide the list of possible
label letters in the `DatasetConfig` (e.g., `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`).

**Available placeholders** in `PromptConfig`:

- `{text}`: The full question text including choices.
- `{label}`: The correct answer letter (empty string for the new sample).
- `{labels_str}`: A formatted string listing all possible answer letters.

)
```

///
/// tab | Token classification

**Task group**: `TaskGroup.TOKEN_CLASSIFICATION`

**Required dataset columns**: `tokens` (list of strings), `labels` (list of strings)

The `tokens` column is a list of word tokens in the text, and the `labels` column is a
list of corresponding BIO tags (e.g., `["o", "b-per", "i-per", "o"]`). The two lists
must have the same length. You must provide the full list of possible labels (including
`"o"`) in the `DatasetConfig`. The `default_prompt_label_mapping` should map BIO labels
to human-readable category names, and for each entity type both `b-X` and `i-X` must map
to the same category string (e.g., `{"b-per": "person", "i-per": "person"}`).

## Output format: Every Eval Ever (EEE)

Each entry written to `euroeval_benchmark_results.jsonl` conforms to the
[Every Eval Ever (EEE) JSON schema v0.2.1](https://github.com/evaleval/every_eval_ever/blob/main/eval.schema.json),
a community-standard format for evaluation reporting.  The file can therefore be
consumed directly by any tool that understands the EEE schema.

Every line is a self-contained JSON object with the following top-level structure:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | EEE schema version (`"0.2.1"`) |
| `evaluation_id` | Unique run identifier in `dataset/model/timestamp` format |
| `evaluation_timestamp` | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the evaluation ran |
| `retrieved_timestamp` | Unix epoch timestamp of when the record was written |
| `source_metadata` | EuroEval organisation info and evaluator relationship |
| `model_info` | Model identifier and EuroEval-specific metadata |
| `eval_library` | Library name/version and evaluation context |
| `evaluation_results` | Array of per-metric scores with uncertainty estimates |

Here is an abbreviated example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "0.2.1",
  "evaluation_id": "angry-tweets/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct/1741260000",

        "score_type": "continuous",
        "min_score": 0,
        "max_score": 100
      },
      "score_details": {
        "score": 42.5,
        "details": { "num_failed_instances": "0.0" },
        "uncertainty": {
          "confidence_interval": {

            "confidence_level": 0.95,
            "method": "bootstrap"
          },
          "num_samples": 10
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

!!! note
    The `_se` values stored internally are 95 % confidence interval half-widths
    (`1.96 × SE`).  They are exposed in the EEE output as a
    `confidence_interval { lower, upper, confidence_level: 0.95 }`, which is the
    correct EEE field for this statistic.

The EEE format can be read back into a `BenchmarkResult` object without any loss of
information:

```python
import json
from euroeval.data_models import BenchmarkResult

with open("euroeval_benchmark_results.jsonl") as f:
    for line in f:
        if line.strip():
            result = BenchmarkResult.from_dict(json.loads(line))
```

## Analysing the results of generative models

### Failed instances

When evaluating a generative model, some samples may fail silently — for example when
the model's output cannot be parsed as JSON (for NER tasks), or when no valid label can
be matched to the model's output (for classification tasks). These failures are now
recorded in `euroeval_benchmark_results.jsonl`.

In `results.raw`, each per-iteration score dictionary contains a `failed_instances` key
with a list of failed samples. Every item in the list has:

- `sample_index` — the 0-based index of the sample within the bootstrapped batch for
  that iteration.
- `error` — a short description of why the sample failed (e.g.
  `"Could not parse JSON from model output"` or
  `"No candidate label found in model output"`).

In `results.total`, the `num_failed_instances` key holds the total count of failed
instances summed across all iterations.

```json
{
  "results": {
    "total": {
      "test_micro_f1": 0.82,
      "test_micro_f1_se": 0.01,
      "num_failed_instances": 3.0
    },
    "raw": [
      {
        "micro_f1": 0.82,
        "failed_instances": [
          {"sample_index": 4, "error": "Could not parse JSON from model output"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If a model never fails (e.g. encoder/fine-tuned models, or a flawless generative run),
`num_failed_instances` will be `0.0` and `failed_instances` will be an empty list for
every iteration.

### Detailed model outputs

If you're evaluating a generative model and want to be able to analyse the model results
more in-depth, you can run your evaluation with the `--debug` flag (or `debug=True` if
using the `Benchmarker`), which will output all the model outputs and all the dataset
metadata (including the ground truth labels, if present) to both the terminal as well as
to a JSON file in your current working directory, named
`<model-id>-<dataset-name>-model-outputs.json`.

It is a JSON dictionary with keys being hashes of the input (which you can just ignore,
it's used for caching during generation), and values being dictionaries with the
following keys:

- `index`: The row index of the sample in the dataset. This allows you to match up the
  sample with the corresponding sample in the dataset.
- `text`/`messages`: The full input prompt used for generation. If the model is a base
  decoder then this will be a string stored in `text`, and if it's an instruction-tuned
  model then this will be an array of dictionaries stored in `messages`. This will
  include all few-shot examples, if any - see the below `prompt` to get the content of
  the present sample, without any few-shot examples.
- `prompt`: The actual example, without any few-shot examples. This is not exactly the
  input to the model (unless you're conducting zero-shot evaluation), but it can be
  handy to separate the actual query that the model was asked to answer.
- `sequence`: The generated sequence by the model.
- `predicted_label`: The predicted label for the generated sequence, if the task has a
  label. This allows you to compare directly with the ground truth label, if present.
- `scores`: An array of shape (`num_tokens_generated`, `num_logprobs_per_token`, 2),
  where the first dimension is the index of the token in the generated sequence, the
  second dimension is the index of the logprob for that token (ordered by most likely
  token to be generated to least likely), and the third dimension is a pair (token,
  logprob) for the token and its logprob. This will only be present if the task requires
  logprobs, and will otherwise be null.
- Any metadata for the sample that was present in the dataset, including the ground truth
  label, if present.

If you sort the rows by this index, you will get the samples in the same order as they
appear in the dataset, effectively just recreating the entire dataset, with the
additional model output features mentioned above. Here's an example of how you can do
this in Python:

```python
>>> import json
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> with open("<model-id>-<dataset-name>-model-outputs.json") as f:
...    model_outputs = json.load(f)
>>> df = pd.DataFrame(model_outputs.values()).set_index('index').sort_index()
>>> df.head()
      sequence predicted_label                                             scores          corruption_type      label                                           messages                                             prompt

0          nej       incorrect  [[[nej, -4.127333340875339e-06], [ja, -12.5000...         flip_nogle_nogen  incorrect  [{'content': 'Sætning: Hej til Bente som jeg v...  Sætning: Peter Elmegaard med nogen af sine hæs...

```

Note that the `index` column is not unique, which is because the model is generating
multiple answers for each sample, but with different few-shot examples. You can see
these few-shot examples in the `messages` column.
